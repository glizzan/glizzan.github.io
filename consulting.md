## Consulting

If you're having problems with the governance of your organization, or are part of a community tackling governance questions for the first time, we can help.

We specialize in working with communities based around building technologies, such as open source software communities, and with volunteer-based communities, but we are open to working with anyone as long as our values align.

We offer free hour-long consulting sessions. Additional things we have done for clients include:

* governance coaching for community managers and others tasked with overseeing the flourishing of a community
* technology audits, where we discuss the social and power dynamics of the technologies a community uses and adjustments or substitutions you may want to make
* iterative development of mission statements, project roadmaps, codes of conduct, and bylaws
* facilitation of convenings for communities seeking to create new governance structures

You may need something else. We will work with you to find the right approach for your community or, if it's beyond our capacity, will try to refer you somewhere that's a better fit for you.

If you're interested, please reach out through our [contact page](https://www.glizzan.com//get-involved/).
