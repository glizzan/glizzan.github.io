## Projects to Check Out

[PolicyKit](https://policykit.org/) "empowers online community members to concisely author a wide range of governance procedures and automatically carry out those procedures on their home platforms". It works with existing platforms such as Slack and Reddit to enhance the ability of communities on those platforms to self-govern. See [this paper](https://policykit.org/static/policyengine/pdf/policykit_uist2020.pdf) to learn more.
