## Concord

Concord is a software package (written in Python, for Django) which makes it easier for websites to implement complex and flexible governance/permissions structures for their users.

## Kybern

[Kybern](https://www.kybern.org/) is a website which implements the Concord library. Please [contact us](https://www.glizzan.com/get-involved/) to get early access to the platform or to learn more. Here's a glimpse at what you can do on Kybern:

## Governance Case Studies

The Pattern Library (above) provides broad overviews of social phenomena that occur across communities or even cultures.  Our case studies go deep instead of broad, exploring the governance structures of specific organizations.
