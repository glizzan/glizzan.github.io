## Concord

Concord is a software package (written in Python, for Django) which makes it easier for websites to implement complex and flexible governance/permissions structures for their users.

We are currently building two prototype websites which use Concord in this way.  One is a governance platform for groups interested in collaboratively exploring new governance structures.  The other is a platform for those interested in addressing the specific problem of online misinformation through collective governance.

## Social Pattern Library

The Social Pattern Library is a collection of social "patterns" - that is, individual behaviors or social phenomena that tend to occur in certain situations.  Through the library, we explore the common outcomes that arise from these patterns, as well as different solutions people have tried to address them.

## Governance Case Studies

The Pattern Library (above) provides broad overviews of social phenomena that occur across communities or even cultures.  Our case studies go deep instead of broad, exploring the governance structures of specific organizations.
