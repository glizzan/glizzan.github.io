## Concord

Concord is a software package (written in Python, for Django) which makes it easier for websites to implement complex and flexible governance/permissions structures for their users.

We are currently building two prototype websites which use Concord in this way.  One is a governance platform for groups interested in collaboratively exploring new governance structures.  The other is a platform for those interested in addressing the specific problem of online misinformation through collective governance.

If you'd like to check out the first project, our governance platform [Kybern](https://www.kybern.org/), email us at glizzanplatform at gmail dot com to get an early access
code.

## Governance Case Studies

The Pattern Library (above) provides broad overviews of social phenomena that occur across communities or even cultures.  Our case studies go deep instead of broad, exploring the governance structures of specific organizations.
