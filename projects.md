## Concord

Concord is a software package (written in Python, for Django) which makes it easier for websites to implement complex and flexible governance/permissions structures for their users. Learn more via the [Github repository](https://github.com/glizzan/glizzan-concord) and [documentation](https://glizzan-concord.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

You can see a demo of the library, and Kybern, a site which implements it, <a href="https://archive.org/details/kybern-metagov">here</a>.


## Kybern

[Kybern](https://www.kybern.org/) is a website which implements the Concord library. The code which runs it can be found [on Github](https://github.com/glizzan/kybern). Please [contact us](https://www.glizzan.com/get-involved/) to get early access to the platform.
